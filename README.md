this is a graduation project for Nile Univeristy students in ITCS the project is  Heatwave Forecasting Using Quantum Machine
 Learning 

 Heatwaves pose serious risks to public health, infrastructure, and economic stability, mak
ing accurate and scalable forecasting methods essential in climate resilience planning. In
 this study, we explore the integration of quantum computing with classical Long Short
Term Memory (LSTM) architectures by evaluating the potential of Quantum Long Short
Term Memory (QLSTM) models for improving heatwave forecast accuracy. The QL
STM replaces classical neural network gates within the LSTM structure with Variational
 Quantum Circuits (VQCs), potentially leveraging quantum advantages such as parame
ter efficiency and richer feature mapping. Meteorological data from multiple global sta
tions—including Cairo, Riyadh, Phoenix, Scottsdale, London, and Barcelona —is col
lected, processed, and used for heatwave forecasting under two configurations: pre
dicting the next day using three days of historical data, and predicting the next three
 days using seven days of input data. Based on preliminary evaluations, the second config
uration is further explored, as it demonstrated stable performance and practical relevance
 for operational heatwave forecasting. The performances of classical LSTM and QLTSM
 are investigated for both configurations for the data collected on the mentioned cities to
 evaluate the generalizability of our approach under varying temperature dynamics and
 climate volatility. IBM’s quantum hardware simulator is used for the QLSTM, and the
 model is tested under realistic noise settings to assess its hardware readiness. Our results
 indicate that QLSTM models achieve comparable, and in some cases slightly stronger
 performance metrics relative to classical LSTM models, despite using significantly fewer
 trainable parameters. This demonstrates their potential efficiency and robustness in cap
turing nonlinear temperature patterns within constrained computational resources.
